The Nim implementation of Waku is called nwaku. It overlaps with the Vac research team, which uses it as a reference implementation for new and innovative protocols. Initial research goes here, with tight feedback loops and synergies with other research projects such as nim-libp2p, Nimbus, Dagger, etc.
