## What is Waku?

Waku is a suite of privacy-preserving, peer-to-peer messaging protocols.

Waku **removes centralized third parties** from messaging,
enabling private, secure, censorship-free communication with no single point of failure.

Waku **provides privacy-preserving** capabilities, such as sender anonymity, metadata protection and unlinkability to personally identifiable information.

Waku is designed for **generalized messaging**, enabling human-to-human, machine-to-machine or hybrid communication.

Waku is aimed at **resource-restricted devices**, such as mobile devices and browsers, but can adapt to any environment.

## How does it work?

The first version of Waku had its origins in the Whisper protocol,
with optimizations for scalability and usability.
Waku v2 is a complete rewrite. Its relay protocol implements pub/sub over libp2p, and also introduces additional capabilities:

1. Retrieving historical messages for mostly-offline devices.
2. Adaptive nodes, allowing for heterogeneous nodes to contribute. 
3. Bandwidth preservation for light nodes.

This makes it ideal for running a p2p protocol on mobile, or in other similarly resource-restricted environments.
