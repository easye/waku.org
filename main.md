Private, secure, and it runs anywhere.

## How does it work?
Waku v1 is a fork of Whisper that primarily improves scalability.
Waku v2 is a complete rewrite. Its relay protocol implements pub/sub over libp2p, and also introduces additional capabilities:
1. Retrieving historical messages for mostly-offline devices.
2. Adaptive nodes, allowing for heterogeneous nodes to contribute. 
3. Bandwidth preservation for light nodes.

This makes it ideal for running a p2p protocol on mobile, or in other similarly resource restricted environments.
