title: Run a Waku v2 node
category: page

## Run a node

Depending on your application there are at least three implementations of Waku v2 to choose from.
We also encourage operators to run their own long-lived nodes.
By running your own Waku v2 node you can help secure the network, provide valuable services to a variety of applications and ensure the future sustainability of the Waku suite of protocols.

### go-waku

go-waku was developed to facilite integration of Waku v2 with the Status client apps. It has grown into a full-fledged Waku v2 client. It is especially useful as a service node embedded in other applications.

### js-waku

js-waku is a JavaScript library focused on dApps, Wallets and Web Apps.

_Get started with js-waku and Waku integration into your dApp [here](https://docs.wakuconnect.dev/)._

### nwaku

Nwaku, the Nim client for Waku v2, is a good option for operator-run nodes, as it is lightweight, serves as the reference implementation and is first in line to support new protocols.
